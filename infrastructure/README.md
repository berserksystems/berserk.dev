# Approach

```
[21:20] James: trying to build a repo where i can write posts in /posts and deploy them from an infrastructure folder with a few calls
[21:21] James: so I could set up a dedicated machine that just hosts the blog and redeploy fresh each time. hopefully nixops is smart like terraform and avoids tearing down the whole thing if it isn't necessary
[21:21] James: post is 3 years old though and I haven't followed it yet, something for the weekend

Apparently NixOps is dying. Above won't be the correct approach in this case.
